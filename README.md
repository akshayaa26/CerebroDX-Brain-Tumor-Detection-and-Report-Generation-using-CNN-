# CerebroDX-Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Report-Generation-using-CNN-
CerebroDx was created in the Flask web application development environment and provides the means for healthcare providers to upload MRI scans, receive classification results in real-time, and generate downloadable diagnostic reports, all within a standard web browser.
In CerebroDx we have used the deep learning model. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify or ibrain conditions, for example, classifying if there are tumors present or 
not.
